      <h5>Bus Factor üöå</h5>
      <div>
        The bus factor (or truck factor) of a project is the number of team
        members whose absence would jeopardize the project (
        <i>hypothetically speaking</i>, hit by a bus). The smallest bus factor
        is 1 and any low number represents a crucial point of failure within the
        team, thus, larger values are preferred. And of course, buses aren't
        usually the biggest threat to teams: illness, vacation, and departure
        from the company are all frequent occurrences on projects. Therefore,
        efforts should be made to increase the bus factor on any project that is
        critical to the organization.
