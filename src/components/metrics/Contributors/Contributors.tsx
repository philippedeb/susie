          A project's bus factor (or truck factor) is a number equal to the
          number of team members who, if run over by a bus, would put the
          project in jeopardy. The smallest bus factor is 1. Larger numbers are
          preferable. Essentially, a low bus factor represents a single point of
          failure within the team. And of course, buses aren't usually the
          biggest threat to teams: illness, vacation, and departure from the
          company are all frequent occurrences on projects. Thus, efforts should
          be made to increase bus factor on any project that is critical to the
          organization.
